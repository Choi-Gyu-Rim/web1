  <p>There are a total of 53 letters in the Javanese script, but the number of represented phonemes (distinct sounds) varies accordingly to the language being written. Each letter represents a syllable, with an inherent vowel /a/ or /ɔ/, which changes depending on the diacritics around the letter. Each consonant has a conjunct form called pasangan (“pair”), which nullifies the inherent vowel of the previous syllable.[5] In the word aksara for example, the inherent vowel of the letter ka is nullified by the use of pasangan in the following letter.
